            <h3>What is a hackathon?</h3>
            <p class="text-left">A hackathon is a way to get a community of enthusiastic people together to build something awesome in a limited period of time. At a hackathon, experienced engineers and interested beginners alike can learn new things, help build innovative solutions to real-world problems, and share their creation with the community, all in one day.

              <h3>When and where is hackPHS?</h3>
              <p>hackPHS will be held in the cafeteria of Princeton High School, located at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/kkXeczMvXWr">151 Moore St, Princeton, NJ</a>. Directions to the cafeteria will be available once you get there. You should plan on arriving before <b>8:00 AM</b> and leaving sometime after <b>10:00 PM</b> on <b>December 2</b>, 2017.</p>

              <h3>How do I apply?</h3>
              <p>hackPHS registrations are conducted via the myMLH system. To register, follow one of the <a href="https://my.mlh.io/oauth/authorize?client_id=1e8697f4c507db8be72fcd37541e7713f2aa8c190b4b6b50654a07dee8212edd&redirect_uri=http://hackphs.com&response_type=token">registration links</a> and fill out the necessary details. You may receive a confirmation email from MLH and hackPHS will show up in your myMLH account under My Profile &rarr; Authorized Apps. If it turns out you really cannot attend please unregister from the event through myMLH. We don't anticipate going over our attendance limit, but unfortunately space is limited to 50 people, and in the event that we cannot take everyone we will accept only the first 50 people to register. Acceptance emails will be sent out a week before the competition - if you are accepted please do your best to show up at the event.</p>

              <h3>What resources will be provided?</h3>
              <p>Free food and drinks will be provided during the hackathon, including vegetarian and dairy-free options. Electrical outlets should be available throughout the cafeteria. We do not plan on providing any materials for hardware hacks - please bring your own equipment if you are planning on building something involving hardware.</p>

              <h3>What should I bring?</h3>
              <p>If you wish to participate, you should bring your own laptop, cellphone, and their chargers. If you need any materials or equipment for your hardware hack, you should bring it yourself. You don't need a predetermined team, an idea for your hack, or any food or drink. As the hackathon will be on school grounds, please refrain from bringing anything that would not be allowed at a high school (no weapons, alcohol, drugs, etc.).</p>

              <h3>My question isn't answered here!</h3>
              <p>Please feel free to email us at team@hackphs.com if you have any other questions about hackPHS.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="col-md-6">
              <h3>Who can attend this event?</h3>
              <p>Sadly, this event is for high schoolers only.</p>

              <h3>What can I win?</h3>
              <p>hackPHS hopes to emphasize learning and collaboration more so than competition - but nonetheless there will be awesome prizes to be won for some the most interesting hacks made during the event. Specifics are TBA, but may include micro drones, headphones, and Arduino starter kits. A team of industry professionals and experienced hackathoners from PHS will be judging hacks based on originality, technical difficulty, usefulness, and usability between 9 and 9:30 PM. To be eligible, all work must have been done within the time limits. The winners will be announced during the closing ceremony, before 10 PM.</p>

              <h3>How should I find a team?</h3>
              <p>Teams of up to 4 people are highly encouraged (though not mandatory), but if you don't have one beforehand that's no problem - hackathons are a great way to meet other enthusiastic people and maybe even make new friends. If you're a first time hackathon attendee and have no idea what to do (everyone was a beginner once), or are an experienced hacker who wants to give back to the community (We love you!), it might be an especially good idea to join our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1456482437770712/">Facebook event</a>. In addition to all the important announcements and information about the event, you'll be able to find others to guide you through the hackathon process and hopefully help you develop something awesome.</p>

              <h3>What can I learn?</h3>
              <p>While you can learn a great deal in the process of building an ambitious project, we also plan to offer some introductory workshops (around 1 hour long) during the event, for those new to software and/or hardware engineering. Specific topics will include Arduino programming, iOS development, and Python, among others.</p>

              <h3>Do you have a code of conduct?</h3>
              <p> All hackers should abide by Major League Hacking's <a href="https://static.mlh.io/docs/mlh-code-of-conduct.pdf">Code of Conduct</a> - TL;DR is you should respect one another. Please also follow any instructions issued by school administrators and teachers while on PHS grounds.</p>
